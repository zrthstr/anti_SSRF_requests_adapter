# anti_SSRF_requests_adapter
### *SSRF protection for Python Requests Library*

### Overview

This library wraps the excellent Python HTTP client library [Requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), by adding several [SSRF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server-side_request_forgery) related security controlls to HTTP requests.

**Disclaimer**: This library is currently in a developmental stage. Due to the lack of extensive test case coverage, it should be considered insecure and, at best, experimental. Nonetheless, these features aim to provide a more secure and controlled HTTP request environment, suitable for developers who prioritize stringent security measures in their applications.

### Features
- **Blocking Requests to Non-Public Internet IPs**: Prevents access to [some](https://github.com/zrthstr/anti_SSRF_requests_adapter/blob/49a7724aba8547d762f91471edb202df465ce13a/anti_SSRF_requests_adapter.py#L31) private and [reserved IP ranges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserved_IP_addresses).
- ~~**Protection Against DNS Rebinding Attacks**: Resolves IP once per session to safeguard against [DNS rebinding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_rebinding).~~
$${\color{red} Vulnerable-to-DNS-REBIND-SSRF}$$ Still can't find a propper way to do this in python with requets or urllib. There is still an exloitable race condidtion. 
- **Disabling HTTP Redirects**: Redirects are not followed by default to maintain control over request destinations. See [redirect-based SSRF](https://portswigger.net/research/top-10-web-hacking-techniques-of-2017#1).
- **Forbidding IPv6 Usage**: Blocks all connections to IPv6 addresses. IPv6 support might be enabled in the future as its implications for SSRF become clearer. PRs are welcome.

### Limitation
- ⛔DNS Rebind based SSRF not fully mitigated⛔ (Any info on how this could be accomplished while still using urllib/requests would be much appreciated)
- currently only `GET` is implemented

### Rationale
This library is potentially beneficial in cases where untrusted input is passed to an HTTP client, which we believe is always the case when:
- DNS is being resolved.
- An untrusted HTTP endpoint is queried, due to the possibility of encountering HTTP redirects (301, 302, 303, 307, 308).
- non-trusted e.g: *user-supplied* input is used to craf a URL

We acknowledge that a more effective approach to securing HTTP client libraries might involve isolation at the OS or network level. However, this library provides an application-level solution as an interim measure.


### Install
```
TBD
pip install git+http://foo/bar

```

### Setup
```
import requests
from anti_SSRF_requests_adapter import AnitSSRFSession

assrf_session = AntiSSRFSession()
```

### Usage
```
try:
    response = assrf_session.get('http://example.com')
    print(response.content)
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

```
